# Generative Music
This was a project I undertook in May of 2021. 
Inspired by Brian Eno and his concept of generative music, I tried to apply my fascination towards generative grammar to build a program that generates new music everytime it is run.
This project basically uses Stochastic Lindermayer Systems (L-Systems), a type of formal grammar used to generate fractals and natural objects like trees, to generate music.
The pdf article "GenerativeMusic.pdf" is a slightly technical article describing my project.
The python file for this project is music.py . It was written in Python 3.
The .mid files are samples of music generated by this program in different scales, with 3 samples generated in F Dorian scale to show how the program generates different music everytime.
